# Loan-risk-Analytic
# Project Description
In this guided project, i Unlocked the fundamentals of data analysis focused on financial risk analytics. I have learned how to leverage Python Pandas to clean, explore, and visualize loan data through data cleaning processes, uncovering insights, and generating key visualizations using Seaborn. at the end of the tutorial, i had hands-on experience conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA), identifying trends and patterns in loan data to assess financial riskâ€”perfect for any loan structure .
## Achievements

 Utilized Python to analyse over 20 000 credit cards applicants job listings and gain 
insights on what it takes to get loan approval.
 Applied Regex techniques to analyse loan data, identifying key requirements, trends, and 
patterns to assess and mitigate financial risk.
 Aggregated and visualized the data by using seaborn,pandas, matplotlib and word cloud
